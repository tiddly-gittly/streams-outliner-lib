title: CHANGELOG

Based on Streams v1.2.24

# Remove all hard-coded view templates
# Refactor view templates to procedures, docs are in readme
# Refactor some config to procedure parameters, also documented
# Add i18n and some zh-Hans translation
# Remove edit-streams widget and its code-mirror5 support
# rename to $:/plugins/linonetwo/streams-outliner-lib showing that I will maintain it (at least for a while)

Released as V1.0.0
