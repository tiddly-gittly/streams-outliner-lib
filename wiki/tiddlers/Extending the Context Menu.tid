title: Extending the Context Menu
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! How can I extend the Context Menu?

The context menu can be extended with additional commands by adding tiddlers with the tag: `$:/tags/streams/contextmenu`

An example of the format and fields required by such a tiddler: [[$:/streams/contextmenu/flatten]]

Required fields:

* `sq-contextmenu-name` : the name of the command.
* `sq-contextmenu-subtitle` : the keyboard shortcut (note that this does not automatically create the shortcut, this text is descriptive only).
* `text` : actions to be triggered when this command is clicked.

You can also add ''keyboard shortcuts'' for the contextmenu item by adding the tag `$:/tags/streams/keyboard-shortcuts` to the same tiddler and configuring they `key` field.
Note that if the `key` field is defined, it takes priority over the `sq-contextmenu-subtitle` field, which is no longer required in that scenario.
