You will need both the Streams plugin, and to allow renaming tiddlers the Relink plugin.

* [[$:/plugins/sq/streams]]
* [[$:/plugins/flibbles/relink]]

Also recommended is the Relink-titles addon plugin for Relink, to preserve your naming scheme for nodes across a rename of the root or parent tiddler.
